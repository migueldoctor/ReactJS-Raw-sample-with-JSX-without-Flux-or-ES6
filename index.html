    <!-- 3) Since the web browser doesn’t understand JSX natively, we need to transform it to JavaScript first. 
    This is handled by including Babel 5’s in-browser ES6 and JSX transformer called browser.js. 
    Babel will recognize JSX code in <script type="text/babel"></script> tags and transform it into JavaScript on the fly. 
    Transforming JSX in the browser works quite well during development. 
    However, you will need to pre-compile your JSX code into JS before deploying to production so that your app renders faster. We will see how to do that later on.

    <!-- 4) Now we create the content using JSX and React library -->
    <!-- NOTE that the script tag includes parameter type with the value text/babel -->
    <!-- 5) What we have done now is to include all React JSX code into the file main.jsx used as parameter for src attribute -->
    <!-- KEEP IN MIND THAT THIS DOESN'T WORK FOR SOME BROWSERS LIKE CHROME, because it only renders jsx code served by a server 
         So you can use Firefox or Safari and if you want to install a light weight server A good one is http-server which can be installed from npm with the following command:

            npm install -g http-server
        And started from your project’s root directory like so:

            http-server
        Your page will now be viewable at http://127.0.0.1:8080/.

    <script type="text/babel" src="./main.jsx"/>
